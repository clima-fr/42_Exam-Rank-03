#  Get_Next_Line

You should create a folder named 'get_next_line' in your 'rendu' directory and include the .c and .h files inside it. 

The assignment only requires the 'get_next_line' function, excluding the main function. 
However, for the purpose of facilitating studying, my main function is commented out in the file.

I have also included a 'test' file that contains the first page of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.


To compile the code, uncomment the main function and use the following command: `cc get_next_line.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=100`

To execute the program, use: `./a.out test.txt`

#  Ft_Printf

Similar to the 'get_next_line', I have also included a main function in the ft_printf code, which is not required for the exam. 

I have added to be able to compare the 'ft_printf' with the standard 'printf' function. It is commented out in the file for reference
and study purposes.

To compile the code, uncomment the main function.
